# WEX: Extensions Library for wxWidgets

WEX is a library of extensions to the [wxWidgets](https://www.wxwidgets.org/) cross-platform user interface (UI) library. These extensions are for custom UI widgets developed for the National Renewable Energy Laboratory's [System Advisor Model™ (SAM™)](https://sam.nrel.gov) and [DView](https://github.com/NREL/wex/wiki/DView) data visualization software.

WEX also includes two executable programs:

_lkscript_ is a code editor for the [LK](https://github.com/NREL/lk) scripting language.
_dview_ is the [DView](https://github.com/NREL/wex/wiki/DView) visualization software for time series data.

# Prerequisites

The WEX libraries require [LK](https://github.com/NREL/lk) for scripting funtionality. Before building the WEX libraries:

1. Build LK.

2. Create an environment variable called `LKDIR` that points to the folder containing the LK libraries.

# Windows

The [build_vs2017](build_vs2017) folder contains project files for Microsoft Visual Studio 2017 (VS 2017).

To build the WEX libraries, open /build_vs2017/wex_vc14.sln in VS 2017 and build debug and release configuration for both win32 and x64. If the builds are successful, you should see the following files:

```
wexvc13wx3.lib
wexvc13wx3d.lib
wexvc13wx3x64.lib
wexvc13wx3x64d.lib
```
You should also see versions of the following executable programs (lkscript may be in a separate subfolder):

```
dview
lkscript
sandbox
```

WEX requires libcurl and SSL libraries for HTTP and HTTPS. Those libraires are precompiled for Windows and included in [build_vs2017/libcurl_ssl_win32] and [build_vs2017/libcurl_ssl_x64]. If you want to rebuild those libraries to incorporate security patches, see [Building libcurl+ssl using VS 2017 For Windows](build_libcurl_ssl_for_windows.md).

# Mac

Makefiles for Mac OS are in the [build_osx](build_osx) folder. Minimum OS X version is 10.9. MacOS 10.12 is used with macosx-version-min=10.9 flag set for wex and SAM releases.

# Linux

Makefiles for Linux are in the [build_linux](build_linux) folder. Minimum requirements: gcc 4.8.5 and glibc 2.17. CentOS 7 is mimimum build platform used for wex and SAM releases.
